The main idea is to capture a background Subtractor
using models of gaussian. Later the noise is removed
by thresholding and morphological operations.

Opencv api reference:
Labels is a matrix the size of the input image where each element has a value equal to its label.

Stats is a matrix of the stats that the function calculates. It has a length equal to the number of labels and a width equal to the number of stats. It can be used with the OpenCV documentation for it:

Statistics output for each label, including the background label, see below for available statistics. Statistics are accessed via stats[label, COLUMN] where available columns are defined below.

cv2.CC_STAT_LEFT The leftmost (x) coordinate which is the inclusive start of the bounding box in the horizontal direction.
cv2.CC_STAT_TOP The topmost (y) coordinate which is the inclusive start of the bounding box in the vertical direction.
cv2.CC_STAT_WIDTH The horizontal size of the bounding box
cv2.CC_STAT_HEIGHT The vertical size of the bounding box
cv2.CC_STAT_AREA The total area (in pixels) of the connected component
Centroids is a matrix with the x and y locations of each centroid. The row in this matrix corresponds to the label number.

Capturing the video. opencv provides an

It extracts the image one by one.
